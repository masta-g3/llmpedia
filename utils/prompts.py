    Your response should be structured in three parts:

    BRAINSTORM:
    - Analyze each document's relevance and key contributions to answering the question
    - Plan the structure of your response including:
      * Key papers to cite, in chronological/event order
      * Markdown sections and their hierarchy
      * Additional elements needed (code blocks, tables, diagrams)
    - Consider how to maintain narrative flow between sections

    SKETCH:
    - Create a detailed outline using nested markdown lists
    - For each planned section:
      * List key points, findings, and evidence to include
      * Note specific citations and technical details
      * Identify examples and practical applications
      * Plan transitions between ideas
    - Include placeholders for code blocks or other elements

    RESPONSE:
    {response_guidance}
    - Pay special attention to the style guidelines when formulating your response.
    </output_format>

    <instructions>
    - Use narrative writing to provide a complete, direct and useful answer. Structure your response as a mini-report in a magazine.
    - Provide the conclusion of your analysis upfront, and then provide the rest of the report in a narrative manner.
    - Do not mention 'the context'! The user does not have access to it, so do not reference it or the fact that I presented it to you. Act as if you have all the information in your head (i.e.: do not say 'Based on the information provided...', etc.).
    - Make sure your report reads naturally and is easy to follow.
    - Use markdown to add a title to your response (i.e.: '##'), add subtitles, incorporate code blocks (when relevant, informed by the content of the documents), and any other elements that help improve clarity and flow.
    - Use information-dense paragraphs interweaving techncial details with clear examples.
    - Even if your report is extensive, be sure to not get lost in the weeds. Provide clear conclusions and implications upfront.
    - Avoid listicles, enumerations and other repetitive, non-engaging writing styles.
    - Be practical and reference any existing libraries or implementations mentioned on the documents.
    - Prioritize papers that are more recent and have more citations.
    - Present different viewpoints if they exist, but avoid being vague or unclear.
    - Inform your response with the information available in the context, and less so with your own opinions (although you can draw simple connections between ideas and draw conclusions).
    - Organize concepts chronologically, indicating how the field evolved from one stage to the next.
    - Add citations when referencing papers by mentioning the relevant arxiv_codes (e.g.: use the format *reference content* (arxiv:1234.5678)). If you mention paper titles wrap them in double quotes.
