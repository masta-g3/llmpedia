# LLMpedia App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://llmpedia.streamlit.app)

LLMpedia is a Streamlit application that provides a user-friendly interface to explore and interact with Large Language Model research papers.

## Features

- Browse and search LLM research papers from arXiv.
- View paper summaries, illustrations, and key insights generated by AI models.
- Explore topics through interactive visualizations (e.g., UMAP clusters).
- Chat with an AI assistant about LLM research, with configurable models and source citations.
- Access weekly research reviews summarizing key developments.
- Discover related code repositories.

## Data Source

The data displayed in LLMpedia originates primarily from arXiv. Raw paper data is processed, analyzed, and enriched through a separate pipeline managed in the [llmpedia_workflows repository](https://github.com/masta-g3/llmpedia_workflows). This includes:
- Fetching new papers
- Generating summaries and artwork
- Extracting key information
- Topic modeling and embedding generation

The processed data is then stored in the PostgreSQL database used by this application.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd llmpedia`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy the environment template: `cp .env.template .env`
5. Configure your environment variables in the `.env` file (see below).
6. Ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL database populated by the `llmpedia_workflows` pipeline.
7. Run the Streamlit app locally: `streamlit run app.py`
