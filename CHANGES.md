- Enhanced token pattern to filter out single-character words
- Improved handling of hyphenated terms in preprocessing
- Updated `plot_trending_words()` function to handle TF-IDF scores
- Added NLTK and scikit-learn to requirements.txt

## Main Page Addition (2024-06-10)

Added a new "Main Page" tab to serve as the landing page for the LLMpedia app:

### Key Features
- Added a new "ðŸ“° Main Page" tab as the first tab in the application
- Added recent paper statistics (1-day and 7-day counts)
- Added category distribution visualization for recent papers
- Added trending topics analysis based on words in recent paper titles
- Added a featured paper section that displays the most cited or recent paper
- Added quick navigation buttons to other tabs
- Added activity statistics (total papers and yearly counts)

### Technical Changes
- Added new plotting functions in `utils/plots.py`:
  - `plot_category_distribution()`: Horizontal bar chart of paper categories
  - `plot_trending_words()`: Horizontal bar chart of trending words in paper titles
- Updated tab indices in `app.py` to accommodate the new tab
- Created documentation files:
  - `STRUCTURE.md`: Documentation of the project structure
  - `CHANGES.md`: This changelog file

### Future Improvements
- Add more advanced trending topic analysis using NLP techniques
- Add personalized recommendations based on user activity
- Add more interactive elements to the Main Page
- Integrate with external APIs for additional research metrics

## Dashboard Weekly Highlight Integration (2024-06-14)

Enhanced the dashboard with dynamic weekly highlights:

- Added utility function `get_latest_weekly_highlight()` in `app_utils.py` to retrieve the most recent weekly highlight from the database
- Modified `create_featured_paper_card()` in `streamlit_utils.py` to automatically use the weekly highlight in the featured content section
- The weekly highlight now includes:
  - The highlight image from arXiv
  - The highlight title extracted from the content
  - A "Read More" button that navigates to the paper details
  - Fallback mechanisms if no highlight is available
- Improved user experience by showing the date of the weekly highlight
- Added better title extraction using regular expressions

These changes ensure the dashboard always shows fresh, curated content and leverages existing weekly highlights to provide value to users immediately upon application load.

## Dashboard Interesting Facts Integration (2024-06-15)

Enhanced the News tab with interesting research facts:

- Added `get_random_interesting_facts()` function to `utils/db/db_utils.py` to retrieve random facts from the database with a bias toward recent ones
- Added `display_interesting_facts()` function to `streamlit_utils.py` to present facts in a clean, consistent style
- Implemented facts display in the News tab as an expandable section before the Recent Activity section
- Each fact includes:
  - The interesting research finding 
  - A link to the source paper
  - Topic badge matching the paper's topic category
